//! Hidden stock over a RANGE of heights (#1316): which stretches of one vertical are air under part material, read from the facets the vertical crosses (the crossing-count form of the point-in-solid test, computational-geometry textbook material, on the winding `slice::shadow_above` reads); our own design, no vendor source.
//!
//! [`super::hidden`] answers one plane per ask: `hidden_at(h)` is the
//! shadow of what hangs over `h`, inside the stock footprint, less the
//! section at `h`. That law is NOT monotone in `h`: the shadow only
//! shrinks as the plane rises, but the section comes and goes, so a
//! column that is hidden stock at one plane (a cavity, a groove, the
//! gap of a T-slot) is part material at a lower one (the floor under
//! it) and drops out there. A band whose bottom sweeps a range of
//! heights over a column therefore cannot be judged at one plane of
//! the range, the lowest included (the #1324 review's counter-probe: a
//! plunge while turning, read at its deep end, passed a cavity the
//! band went through on the way down).
//!
//! So the swept backstop asks the whole range, and this module answers
//! it EXACTLY in Z for the column it is asked at. Walk the vertical
//! through `q` down from above the part, counting the solid's depth:
//! +1 at a facet facing up (entering material from above), -1 at one
//! facing down. A stretch at depth 0 with a crossing above it is air
//! (or uncut stock) that part material hangs over - precisely the
//! `(q, h)` the plane law calls hidden: `shadow_above(h)` holds `q`
//! (a down-facing facet stands above) and the section at `h` does not.
//! Counting depth rather than parity reads touching or overlapping
//! bodies (M13.11) as their union. The rest of the plane law is a
//! bound on `h` and is applied as one: under the stock top, and below
//! the lowest earlier cut that cleared the column less `z_tol`
//! (`Rest::uncut`'s walk, which convicts `h` iff no clearing chord
//! stands at or below `h + z_tol`).
//!
//! No sampling in Z, so no hidden slab can slip between planes however
//! thin - down to [`THIN`], the slicer's own plane nudge, under which
//! two faces are the same face to every plane law. A vertical that
//! cannot be read (it grazes an edge three times over, or the walk
//! does not close: an open or inside-out shell) convicts, fail closed.
